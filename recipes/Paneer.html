    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a pan on medium heat. 
            Once the oil is hot, add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, 
            cloves and saute for few seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Then add the the onion, garlic, ginger and 
            saute for 2 to 3 minutes until the onion is translucent.
        </li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and cashews and mix.
        </li>
        <li>Then add 1 cup of water.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook on medium heat for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, remove the pan from heat.
            Remove the bay leaf, cinnamon stick and cloves.
        </li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool down a bit and then transfer to a blender. 
            Itâ€™s important to let it cool down a bit else it will all blow up from the mixer.
        </li>
        <li>Grind the masala to a smooth paste and set aside.

        </li>
        <li>To the same pan now add 2 tablespoons butter 
            along with remaining 1 teaspoon oil on medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the butter melts, add the red chili powder and the Kashmiri red chili powder
            and fry for few seconds. This will give the curry a nice red color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add the ground paste back into the pan along with the garam masala (start with 1/2 teaspoon and add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon 
            at the end only if you feel like the curry needs that extra bit of garam masala), 
            cardamom powder, sugar, salt and tomato paste (if using).
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix well and cook for 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add the cream and mix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in the paneer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on medium heat. 
            Finally add crushed kasuri methi.
        </li>
        <li>
