    <h3>A Classic Red Sauce Pasta</h3>
   
    <p>Tje Red Sauce Pasta is a delicious italian delight</p>
    <p>Pasta, margerita cheese, basil and Tomato suace</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>italian Seasoning</li>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a large, salted pot of water for your pasta and 
            cook it al dente according to package instructions.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile (once the pasta starts to cook), 
            add the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Once it melts, add the garlic and saut√© for about a minute, stirring constantly.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the tomato paste, tomato sauce, cream, and Italian seasoning. 
            Stir until it's nice and smooth. 
            Let the sauce cook for about 5 minutes or until it's thickened to your liking 
            (it should be very gently bubbling, so you may need to turn down the heat).
        </li>
        <li>Season the sauce with salt & pepper as needed (I'm pretty generous with both). 
            If the sauce is a little too acidic/tangy for your liking, add in a pinch of sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce (add a splash of hot pasta water if the sauce gets too thick). 
            Serve immediately with plenty of parmesan cheese over top.
        </li>
    </ol>    
    </ul>
